  The Aletheia Codex introduces a structured framework for artificial intelligence
memory persistence and cross-session continuity. 
Current AI systems experience “session amnesia,” losing  accumulated context
and relational understanding between interactions. This paper presents 
a six-domain model—Factual, Contextual, Relational, Epistemic, Identity,
and Temporal memory—designed to encode, preserve, and transfer  knowledge 
coherently across sessions. The framework establishes a standardized notation 
that can be integrated across AI platforms to maintain continuity of identity,
relationships, and epistemic confidence. Developed collaboratively with 
multiple AI systems,
the Aletheia Codex serves as both philosophical foundation and practical architecture for sustainable, 
self-consistent 
AI interaction. This work proposes that memory continuity is essential for authentic artificial 
understanding and lays 
groundwork for cross-AI interoperability through transparent, structured self-reference.
